#AI Study Repository

Welcome to my AI study repository! In this repository, you will find a variety of projects that I have created while studying artificial intelligence. While the projects may not be directly related to each other, they are all focused on the subject of AI study.

##List of Projects:

Neural Network for Image Classification: This project is focused on building a neural network from scratch using Python and the NumPy library to classify images. The network uses the backpropagation algorithm for training.

Reinforcement Learning Game: In this project, I have built a simple game using Pygame and implemented a reinforcement learning algorithm to train an AI agent to play the game.

Natural Language Processing: This project focuses on using Python's Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) to perform sentiment analysis on a dataset of tweets.

Computer Vision: In this project, I have used OpenCV to detect faces in images and videos.

Machine Learning Pipeline: This project demonstrates a complete machine learning pipeline, including data preprocessing, feature selection, model selection, and evaluation.

Generative Adversarial Networks: This project explores the use of GANs for image generation, using PyTorch to implement the model.

Each project is contained within its own folder and includes a README file with a brief overview and instructions for running the code.

I hope you find these projects useful and informative in your own AI studies. If you have any questions or suggestions, please feel free to reach out to me.
